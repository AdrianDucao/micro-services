# micro-services
a proof of concept for building and learning containerized web or native applications using docker.

# What is Docker?
it is a platform that creates a containerized application, much like virtualmachine but without the need of hypervisor since it can run in any OS.

# Why containerized?
### Advantages
* Environment - you can specificly create a container that replicates the dev environment now developers have no reason to say "well, it worked in dev, ops problem now" kinda meme.
* Mobile - container images can be deployed and run on any servers and workstation.
* Scalable - for a small project this won't matter, but for projects that needs scaling fast and with microservice archetecture this is suitable and more powerful when paired with Kubernetes.
### Disadvantages
* Learning Docker
* Learning Kubernetes
* Implementing to Projects that doesn't really need it.
